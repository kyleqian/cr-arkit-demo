  transcriptions:
  - "I guess I view it much like a memorial. I think that people choose to go there
    knowing what they\u2019re getting into."
  - "I understand if someone is not aware that\u2019s there and stumbles upon it and
    gets triggered \u2026 I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen enough
    to make it worth not putting it there."
  - "Like Budapest where you\u2019ll be walking along the river and there\u2019s all
    these empty shoes as a Holocaust memorial."
  - "And that\u2019s extremely triggering but you go there knowing what you\u2019re
    getting into and because it\u2019s so emotional it\u2019s such a powerful way
    to try to think about what happened there and the magnitude of that."
  - "Because I think that even if you learn about something and do your best to try
    to conceptualize it in your mind, until you\u2019re in the space and really trying
    to understand it\u2026"
  - "You still won\u2019t, for most people. But it at least offers some extra level
    of compassion for what happened there."
  - "While they built a memorial in that space they haven\u2019t made that space any
    safer by adding that memorial."
  - "Half of Lake Lag is still unlit, and I think that a lot of things still need
    to change at Stanford before it\u2019s considered anywhere near a safe campus
    for women."
  - We can also celebrate those and feel good about the small wins, because there
    are very few in this field, while also using those as motivation to continue the
    fight.
  - "I guess I would just want people to know that there\u2019s a lot of us who spent,
    not just myself, but many people before me, too,"
  - who spent all four years of their Stanford education fighting to make the campus
    a better place for women and a safer place for women.
  - And that if they ever feel alone in fighting for those issues or they ever feel
    like the administration is against them or just that the general social construct
    at Stanford is against them,
  - that there have been so many wonderful women and allies that have fought for them
    and are standing here supporting them.
