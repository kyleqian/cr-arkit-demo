  transcriptions:
  - I guess I view it much like a memorial. I think that people choose to go there
    knowing what they're getting into.
  - I understand if someone is not aware that's there and stumbles upon it and gets
    triggered... I just don't think that's going to happen enough to make it worth
    not putting it there.
  - Like Budapest where you'll be walking along the river and there's all these empty
    shoes as a Holocaust memorial.
  - And that's extremely triggering but you go there knowing what you're getting into
    and because it's so emotional it's such a powerful way to try to think about what
    happened there and the magnitude of that.
  - Because I think that even if you learn about something and do your best to try
    to conceptualize it in your mind, until you're in the space and really trying
    to understand it...
  - You still won't, for most people. But it at least offers some extra level of compassion
    for what happened there.
  - While they built a memorial in that space they haven't made that space any safer
    by adding that memorial.
  - Half of Lake Lag is still unlit, and I think that a lot of things still need to
    change at Stanford before it's considered anywhere near a safe campus for women.
  - We can also celebrate those and feel good about the small wins, because there
    are very few in this field, while also using those as motivation to continue the
    fight.
  - I guess I would just want people to know that there's a lot of us who spent, not
    just myself, but many people before me, too,
  - who spent all four years of their Stanford education fighting to make the campus
    a better place for women and a safer place for women.
  - And that if they ever feel alone in fighting for those issues or they ever feel
    like the administration is against them or just that the general social construct
    at Stanford is against them,
  - that there have been so many wonderful women and allies that have fought for them
    and are standing here supporting them.
