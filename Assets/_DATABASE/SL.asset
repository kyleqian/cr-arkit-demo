  - 'The only time that I''ve ever really engaged with the memorial was in the spring. '
  - 'I went to Endless KA [Kappa Alpha], and that was the first time that I had seen
    it or heard about it. '
  - 'I remember making some sort of comment like... this is great that it''s here
    but... '
  - 'There are a bunch of drunk kids walking all over it and have no idea what it
    means, or what it stands for, or why it''s here. '
  - 'The generation of Stanford students that are 4, 5, 10 years removed aren''t going
    to have that same kind of connection to the Brock Turner case. '
  - 'I don''t think they''re going to have as much connection to what happened because
    it''s not as close to them. '
  - 'So I think in that regard, I think a plaque is necessary to have some sort of
    literary reminder. '
  - 'Rather than just a pond that looks pretty from the outside. '
