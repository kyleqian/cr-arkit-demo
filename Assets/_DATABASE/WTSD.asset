  transcriptions:
  - 'I had just started writing for the student groups beat of The Daily and I saw,
    they made some kind of sign or something and hung it in White Plaza (the organizers
    of the protest), advertising, "speak out!" and I saw it, and was like, we should
    be covering this. '
  - "I mean I was surprised by how many people were present, I think, in a positive
    way. Seeing that I could see it from my window\u2026 "
  - 'I remember, I think before term started, I was in my room, and I heard male students
    basically talking about their sexual exploits in the garden.  '
  - 'And, I mean, the irony was pretty extreme.  '
  - 'I think that what certain memorials do very well, and some do less well, is rather
    than trying to represent a tragedy, they try to represent the unrepresentability
    of it. '
  - 'Because I don''t think you can represent pain like this.  '
  - 'And I think part of why I don''t love the idea of the garden is just because
    it does nothing to represent unrepresentability.  '
  - 'You know, it does not resemble the place where Doe was assaulted any more, and
    there is something violent about that act of erasure, I think.  '
  - 'You know, I don''t think a memorial can just skip to the "happy ending." Then
    what is it memorializing? '
  - 'I mean, I do think that Emily Doe''s voice should be present there, and I do
    hope that that is something that can be heard in 10 years, or 20 years, or 30
    years.  '
