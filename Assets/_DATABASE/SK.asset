  transcriptions:
  - 'When I ran, I knew I wanted to work on fixing Title IX, but I didn''t really
    know enough to know what that meant at the time. '
  - 'Nothing has happened. It''s been almost a year at this point since the conversations
    broke down. '
  - 'I think essentially, there was an impasse that was reached where the university
    said, "We don''t think the quotes that Emily Doe wants are appropriate for this
    location,"  '
  - 'and then I think at that point that there was just frustration and desire to
    no longer move forward with the project.  '
  - 'I don''t think there''s going to be a plaque. I''m in support of... whatever
    would empower Emily Doe. '
  - 'Say there were a student standing there 5-10 years from now and they were just
    looking at it, and they were like, oh, what is this? I would want them to know
    the whole story.  '
  - 'I''d want them to know what had happened there.  '
  - "I feel like there's already so many stories that have been lost and so much pain
    that\u2026 becomes cyclical because people don't remember things.  "
  - 'And that, you know, it''s not just a pretty landscaping project, it''s masking
    a lot of pain that was there before.  '
