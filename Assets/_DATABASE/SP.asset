  transcriptions:
  - My name is Stephanie Pham and I graduated from Stanford in 2018.
  - Starting when I was a sophomore, I co-founded the Stanford Association of Students
    for Sexual Assault Prevention (ASAP).
  - And I spent most of my undergraduate career organizing petitions and demonstrations
    to really try to change the way Stanford treats survivors.
  - Along with Matthew Baiza, I decided to do a pretty bold demonstration, and that
    was September 2015, and we stood at the center of campus in White Plaza holding
    signs that declared,
  - '"Rape happens here."'
  - June of my sophomore year, that's when her [Emily Doe's] letter went viral, I
    remember thinking we need to figure out a way to use these emotions and use this
    energy in a way that was productive.
  - The issue of the plaque came about. When I heard that Stanford had done wrong
    by her again, rejecting her quotes, then proposing quotes like, what was it? "I'm
    right here, I'm okay, everything's okay, I'm right here,"
  - I remember being absolutely infuriated.
  - I saw the plaque as, here's Stanford's opportunity to do something right, finally.
    The agreement in Emily Doe agreeing to this-- she got to choose the quote.
  - But in the end, that promise didn't really matter. What mattered was, how did
    Stanford look at the end of the day?
  - Being a senior at this point, I remember seeing that and being like, wow, I've
    been here four years, I've been working on this issue, for what? Almost the entirety
    of my Stanford career.
  - How is it still this bad?
  - With all this emotion, and all these thoughts running through my head as a senior,
    hoping to close out my year in a positive way, I was like, let's do one more rally.
  - We were able to make the memorial what it was supposed to be, which was, in my
    opinion, a place for people to contemplate, to be honest, to share their experiences,
    and to be comfortable and safe.
  - I mean, this is maybe very idealistic of me, but I would hope that students will
    continue fighting for Emily Doe's voice to be heard in that space, and keep holding
    Stanford accountable for its promises.
  - I wouldn't be where I am today if I weren't just slightly optimistic, or idealistic,
    that hopefully something will change.
  -
