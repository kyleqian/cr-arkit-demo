  transcriptions:
  - 'I was surprised the university would memorialize and create a permanent space
    around this incident. '
  - 'My perspective on ASSU was that the obligation that we have is to make sure that
    we express the voices in rooms that aren''t otherwise being heard. '
  - '[The rally in 2018 organized by ASAP] embodied that exactly. It was about survivors;
    survivors are often... their voices go unheard.'
  - A survivor was promised a platform for her voice to be heard, and then that was
    snatched in almost a last-minute fashion.
  - 'So when the rally took place, the statements that were requested by Emily Doe
    were not yet public. The question then was not around the content of the plaques.  '
  - 'It is solely about the agency of Emily Doe which I think is another important
    mirror to this whole situation. '
  - 'Having been in the room and having heard things in confidence with different
    levels of university leadership  '
  - 'And understanding that I truly do believe that people are in these positions
    because they love the institution and they love working with students '
  - 'I don''t think there''s a point where everyone would be happy with it.  '
  - 'It''s a space without context. I would be cautious of trying to redo the push
    for a plaque, necessarily. '
  - 'It might not be that this plaque needs to exist. We need to preserve the original
    goal which is to create institutional memory for this space. '
  - 'Is that through a plaque? Probably not, because that''s what we already went
    through and these were the pitfalls that came out about that.  '
  - 'But are there other ways? Are there other means? And what is the need to create
    context for this space? '
