  transcriptions:
  - "My name is Noah Hornik. I\u2019m a senior in Kappa Alpha. Brock Turner specifically--
    obviously, everyone is on the right side there."
  - "Like, fuck this kid. He did something terrible, and we feel really bad that it
    was in such close proximity to the house, but it wasn\u2019t actually someone
    in the house. "
  - "Yeah, I just think it\u2019s strange to almost memorialize \u2026 obviously,
    it was huge in the news, but it\u2019s weird to make some nice fountain, like
    some very zen place to memorialize that, where I don\u2019t think most people
    who go by there realize what it even is. "
  - "They should have used her quote, for sure. I remember the event where newscasters
    were here and there was the big rally outside of the fountain because they didn\u2019t
    use her quote. I was there for that."
  - It would have made it more meaningful and actually done something more significant
    if they had.
  - "I mean, I don\u2019t know who is leaving beer cans and Juul pods there, but I
    think everyone in KA is very acutely aware that that is an important space and
    don\u2019t misuse it. "
  - "When you have so many people coming over, you can\u2019t necessarily control
    the space, so it gets misused\u2026 due to us, because we are throwing a party,
    but also not due to us because people just don\u2019t understand."
  - "So I think it\u2019s kind of a give and take there where the space is not necessarily
    saying what it should."
  - "Yeah, it\u2019s definitely complicated by being next to a fraternity house, for
    sure.  "
  - "I\u2019m just thinking about freshmen who come to the house. If they walk there
    and haven\u2019t been exposed to a scene like this before, I think it would be
    more significant, too, to have something like that near our house where it\u2019s
    like,"
  - "\u201COh, I\u2019m coming to this party, and I can do whatever the fuck I want,
    \u2018cause I\u2019m in college now.\u201D And they walk by that and they\u2019re
    like, \u201COh, shit.\u201D "
  - "Having something like that near this house, not that that kind of stuff happens
    here, but just generally near a fraternity, like, understanding that when you
    come to college, everything doesn\u2019t go. "
  - 'I think that would be huge. '
