  transcriptions:
  - 'My name is Noah Hornik. I''m a senior in Kappa Alpha. Brock Turner specifically
    -- obviously, everyone is on the right side there. '
  - 'Like, fuck this kid. He did something terrible, and we feel really bad that it
    was in such close proximity to the house, but it wasn''t actually someone in the
    house.  '
  - Yeah, I just think it's strange to almost memorialize... obviously, it was huge
    in the news, but it's weird to make some nice fountain, like some very zen place
    to memorialize that, where I don't think most people who go by there realize what
    it even is.
  - 'They should have used her quote, for sure. I remember the event where newscasters
    were here and there was the big rally outside of the fountain because they didn''t
    use her quote. I was there for that. '
  - 'It would have made it more meaningful and actually done something more significant
    if they had. '
  - 'I mean, I don''t know who is leaving beer cans and Juul pods there, but I think
    everyone in KA is very acutely aware that that is an important space and don''t
    misuse it.  '
  - 'When you have so many people coming over, you can''t necessarily control the
    space, so it gets misused... due to us, because we are throwing a party, but also
    not due to us because people just don''t understand. '
  - 'So I think it''s kind of a give and take there where the space is not necessarily
    saying what it should. '
  - 'Yeah, it''s definitely complicated by being next to a fraternity house, for sure.  '
  - 'I''m just thinking about freshmen who come to the house. If they walk there and
    haven''t been exposed to a scene like this before, I think it would be more significant,
    too, to have something like that near our house where it''s like, '
  - '"Oh, I''m coming to this party, and I can do whatever the fuck I want, ''cause
    I''m in college now." And they walk by that and they''re like, "Oh, shit."  '
  - 'Having something like that near this house, not that that kind of stuff happens
    here, but just generally near a fraternity, like, understanding that when you
    come to college, everything doesn''t go.  '
  - 'I think that would be huge. '
