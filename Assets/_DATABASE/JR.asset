  transcriptions:
  - The first time I saw the memorial site was when you visit for your draw, your
    in-house draw.
  - And so I was scoping out the house and I noticed this beautiful fountain and bench,
    and I explicitly thought, this is an awesome, beautiful, little site that I would
    love to sit at, because you can hear this little fountain, and I since would go
    there with my girlfriend.
  - "We\u2019d just sit there and listen to the fountain."
  - Had no idea what it was for. Made no connection. Just thought it was a really
    beautiful space.
  - And then when I looked it up, I immediately recalled all of the controversy about
    the plaque and the quotations, and obviously, the event.
  - "But to be honest, had no idea that I\u2019d been living right next to where the
    event occurred that whole time."
  - "I would really appreciate there being some marker because I think\u2026 I didn\u2019t
    appreciate being naive about it, and enjoying it without understanding what it\u2019s
    there for."
  - "I think there\u2019s value in understanding concretely where the event occurred."
  - "You can live in a little bit more of a bubble pretending that it didn\u2019t
    occur or that it\u2019s distant from your life."
  - "But to understand that this occurred right where I\u2019m living is kind of impactful."
  - "They really need to put the victim\u2019s interests first, and so I think it
    should be a priority to have some sort of memorial instead of it being stuck in
    some kind of limbo indefinitely."
