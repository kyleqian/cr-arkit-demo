  transcriptions:
  - I was a freshman starting in 2014, the same time that Brock Turner was a freshman,
    and I actually lived in his dorm.
  - I did live close enough to him where I would run into him in the hallways. I ate
    breakfast with him once.
  - "I heard about how he disappeared one day. Like, he was just gone. And then the
    news came out, and we were like, oh, that\u2019s why."
  - I just felt a little freaked out at how something that was nationally known was
    so close to home.
  - "It\u2019s just like you\u2019re shocked that you ever interacted with someone
    like that."
  - I was thinking, [Emily Doe] write so powerfully. Like, whoever she is, she is
    so amazing at giving herself a voice.
  - "So what I heard was that Stanford proposed a quote, and it was something like,
    \u201CEverything is okay,\u201D or \u201CIt\u2019s going to be okay,\u201D or
    it had the word \u201Cokay\u201D in it."
  - "So I would definitely say that the victim\u2019s decision should be ranked higher
    than whatever anyone else wants."
  - "Say you\u2019re not aware that this is a memorial and that you do happen by it
    and you are a survivor and the quote is something that is very graphic, you wouldn\u2019t
    want that."
  - "So, I\u2019d want to make sure that whatever plaque is put there doesn\u2019t
    make people feel anxious in a space that\u2019s already caused so much pain."
  - "But I also don\u2019t speak for all survivors, so\u2026"
  - "I like having some choice in what I see. Even though I think it\u2019s good to
    stay woke and aware of what\u2019s happening, but sometimes I just need to not
    think about these things as much."
