  transcriptions:
  - 'I was a freshman starting in 2014, the same time that Brock Turner was a freshman,
    and I actually lived in his dorm. '
  - 'I did live close enough to him where I would run into him in the hallways. I
    ate breakfast with him once.  '
  - 'I heard about how he disappeared one day. Like, he was just gone. And then the
    news came out, and we were like, oh, that''s why.  '
  - 'I just felt a little freaked out at how something that was nationally known was
    so close to home.  '
  - 'It''s just like you''re shocked that you ever interacted with someone like that.  '
  - '[When I read the victim impact statement,] I was thinking, this person writes
    so powerfully. Like, whoever she is, she is so amazing at giving herself a voice.  '
  - 'So what I heard was that Stanford proposed a quote, and it was something like,
    "Everything is okay," or "It''s going to be okay," or it had the word "okay" in
    it. '
  - 'So I would definitely say that the victim''s decision should be ranked higher
    than whatever anyone else wants. '
  - 'Say you''re not aware that this is a memorial and that you do happen by it and
    you are a survivor and the quote is something that is very graphic, you wouldn''t
    want that.  '
  - 'So, I''d want to make sure that whatever plaque is put there doesn''t make people
    feel anxious in a space that''s already caused so much pain.  '
  - But I also don't speak for all survivors, so...
  - 'I like having some choice in what I see. Even though I think it''s good to stay
    woke and aware of what''s happening, but sometimes I just need to not think about
    these things as much.  '
